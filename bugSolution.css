To solve the `calc()` issue, ensure the parent container's width is explicitly defined or use a different approach to calculate the width.  You might use JavaScript to determine the width dynamically, or provide default values and handle exceptions gracefully.

To address the specificity problem, use more specific CSS selectors, or adjust the order of your CSS rules in your stylesheet.  More specific selectors, such as IDs (#id) have higher precedence than class selectors (.class) and type selectors (div). Using the `!important` flag should be avoided as a general solution, as it can lead to less maintainable code. The solution should also be focused in properly addressing specificity rules, and potentially reorganizing the stylesheet to ensure the desired styles are applied correctly.
